# User Authentication System in Node.js

## Overview

Welcome to the User Authentication System in Node.js project! This system provides a robust and secure solution for implementing user authentication in your web applications. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex web platform, this project offers a scalable and customizable authentication system powered by Node.js.

## Features

1. **Secure Authentication Process:**
   User credentials are handled with the highest level of security. Passwords are hashed using strong cryptographic algorithms to protect sensitive information.
