## Features 🛠️

- **Secure Authentication:** Passwords are hashed using strong cryptographic algorithms, ensuring the highest level of security for user data.
  
- **Token-based Authentication:** Implementing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for a stateless and scalable authentication process.
  
- **Customizable User Roles:** Tailor the authentication system to your application's needs with customizable user roles and permissions.
